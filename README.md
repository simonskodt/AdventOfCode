# AdventOfCode

This is my first year participating in the Advent of Code, a series of small programming challenges released every day from December 1st to December 25th. The challenges are self-contained and are meant to be completed in order, with each one building upon the skills and knowledge gained from the previous ones.

In this repository, you will find my solutions to the challenges from the first year of the Advent of Code. The solutions are written in different programming languages (mainly Java) and are well-commented to explain my thought process and the techniques used to solve the challenges.
